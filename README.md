# Landing Page 

I recently completed an assignment where I created a landing page using React with the Next.js framework. For the styling, I used Tailwind CSS, along with React Icons and Framer Motion for a touch of animation. 🌐💻

This project not only challenged my skills but also taught me how to blend efficiency with creativity—much like effective talent management in a company. Here's to continuous learning and innovative problem-solving in both tech and HR! 🚀🔧
